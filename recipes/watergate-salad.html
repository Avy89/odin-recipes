        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When it comes to summer desserts, ice cream often gets all the fame. Ice cream is pretty great, but watergate salad is one
       of my favorite underated summer desserts. If you've never tried watergate salad because it looks a little strange, you should really
       give it a shot.    
        </p>
        <p>Watergate salad is a perfect combo of textures. At the base you've got pistachio flavored Jell-O and whipped cream. Then,
            for crunch, you've got some chopped pecans. Finally, you have juicy pineapple and sweet marshmallows that bring in all dimensions of 
            sweetness.
