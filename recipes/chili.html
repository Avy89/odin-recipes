<p><h2>Enjoy the perfect combo of sweet, smoky, and spicy with this unique chili recipe.</h2></p>
<p>When I was first learning to cook, I started my search for a good chili recipe because I felt like chili was
a staple dish that everyone who calls themselves a good cook should know how to make. The problem is, I hate chunks
of tomatoes in my food and I quickly learned finding a good chili recipe that doesn't include tomatoes is 
hard! I tried a few different ones I found before, <strong>voila</strong>, I found <em>the one</em>. 
</p>
<p>This chili is perfectly balanced to hit all the sections of your palate. The beef and black beans bring the savory
while the baked beans and brown sugar add the sweet. Then, the fresh sorrano peppers, chili powder, and cayenne 
pepper step in to provide the heat you're usually hoping for when you have a bowl of chili. Finally, as an unexpected twist, a hint
of smoky paprika comes in to finish off your senses.  
</p>
<p>Now that your mouth is watering, lets learn how to cook it!</p>
